                <h2>I build websites from scratch</h2>
                <p>Every single one. No Squarespace, no Wix, no WordPress themes. Just code.</p>
                <p>Why? Because templates force you into boxes that weren't made for you. Your business isn't generic, so why should your site be?</p>

                <h2>How it actually works</h2>
                <p>We talk. You tell me what you're building and who it's for. I design something that fits, then code it by hand.</p>
                <p>You get the source files, full control, no recurring fees to some platform. It's yours.</p>

                <h2>NO TEMPLATES</h2>
                <p>Everything gets built from zero. Raw code. No drag-and-drop bullshit, no "premium themes."</p>
                <p>You want something that hits different? That's what custom means. Built for your exact needs, not whoever else bought the same template.</p>

                <p>You get the code. You own it. Done.</p>

                <h2>Every site is custom</h2>
                <p>Like, actually custom. Not "choose from 50 templates" custom. Hand-coded, designed specifically for you kind of custom.</p>
                <p>Because your brand has personality and templates don't. Simple as that.</p>

                <p>No compromising because "the theme doesn't support that." If you can imagine it, I can build it.</p>
