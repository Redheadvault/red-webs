                <p>I don't touch templates. Every site I build starts with a blank file and ends with something that's actually yours.</p>
                <p>You tell me what you're trying to do, who you're talking to, what matters. I build it. No bullshit filler pages, no features you'll never use, no "recommended plugins."</p>

                <h2>The work takes 2-4 weeks</h2>
                <p>Design, build, revisions, done. You get the code, the files, everything. It's yours.</p>
                <p>I work with people who know templates aren't going to cut it. Small businesses, artists, anyone building something real who needs their site to match.</p>
